          <p>
            I am a passionate and multidisciplinary student at NC State
            University, intending to triple major in Computer Science, Economics,
            and Applied Mathematics, with a minor in Cognitive Science. My
            interests span responsible AI development/research, economics,
            neuroscience, bioinformatics, and policy, and I seek to leverage
            data-driven insights to address global challenges in healthcare,
            education, sustainability, and more.
